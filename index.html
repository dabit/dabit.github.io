<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I have been writing software for almost 15 years now.
My current weapon of choice is Ruby, Rails and everything related to it.
I ran <a href="http://www.crowdint.com" target="_BLANK">Crowd Interactive</a>,
a Software Development consultancy, for almost 5
years. While doing so I sent more than a few websites to production and
helped keeping them operational when traffic really picked up.
I enjoy sharing the word by organizing local community events and speaking
at conferences all around the world. </p>
<p>You can see a list of ruby gems I’ve written at: </p>

<p><strong>February 2010 - December 2014 (4 years 11 months)</strong></p>
<p>During my almost 5 year run at the head of Crowd Interactive, I managed to turn a relatively unknown, small Ruby on Rails dev shop headquartered in the middle of nowhere, Mexico, into one of the most recognized software development consultancies in the country while at the same time establishing a solid base to do business mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
<p>Mexico is a great place to find talent for Software Development that can service the United States, due to its geographical positioning, time zone and cultural similarities. Crowd Interactive has managed to take advantage of these factors to effectively service a variety of startups from both the West and East Coast in the US. Supporting the local communities was always at the top of my priority list as it helped me understand the local talent, build a network and hire only the best engineers that I could.</p>
<p>One of the biggest initiative to come out of this effort is MagmaConf (www.magmaconf.com), the only
Software Development Conference of its kind in Mexico, and due to its unique format, the world. </p>
